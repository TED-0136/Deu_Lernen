# Deu_Lernen 【德語小火車】
<strong>Just a little project for my course. <br><br>
Files here are not complete cuz I am not sure how to use Github properly</strong> 

<h2>Introduction </h2>
This is a little Game made with Pygame. <br><br>
The purpose of this project is to combine programming and language learning. <br><br>
The goal of our team is to make a little game, which can help children in Taiwan learn German in a fun way <br> <br>
Inspire their interests in learing German. <br><br>

<h2>Example</h2>

![Example Image](https://github.com/TED-0136/Deu_Lernen/blob/main/Example.png)

By displaying an image, children can easily understand what the German word means. <br><br>
If clicking the little car icon, they can listen to the pronunciation of the word, make they better memorize the word. <br><br>
